## Description

### What is this task?

To this date there is no official Stellar SDK written for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  
There are some efforts for creating inofficial ones, but most of these haven't been updated in years.

### What are the requirements for the bounty hunter?

The developer should have sufficent knowledge of the Stellar SDK and the Rust programming lanuage in order to create or update an exisiting Rust library.

### What are the deliverables?

*Description* <br>
  * The developer should provide a complete integration of the Stellar SDK as a Rust crate. (This does not have to be reinventing the wheel.)
  * The function set should be compareable to the [JS SDK >=v8.2.4](https://github.com/stellar/js-stellar-sdk).
  * The SDK should be fully documented.

*Judging Criteria and Metrics* <br>
  * Code Quality - Is the code well-organized and documented? Does it adhere to language-specific style guidelines?
  * Expandability - Is the code easy to maintain? How easy can future SEPs be implemented?
  * Documentation - Is the SDK sufficently documented? Is it  easily possible for an average developer to use this SDK?
  
*Submission Procedure* <br>
  * Submit a link to your repository as a comment on the specific issue thread for this bounty
